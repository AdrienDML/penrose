- multi monitor support
  - some things work fine but there are lots of issues. Need to get an idea of what needs to be done
    and then work out a plan of attack

- additional user facing actions:
  - move client to screen
  - focus screen
  - cycle workspaces

- auto-float all dialogues / pop ups

- Handle mouse events (drag and resize for floating windows)
  - Eventually click to WS switch and other actions from the status bar but that's a long way off

- track focused monitor with multi-monitor setup
  - Should be doable with the X-root position info that comes with most events? Need to unack that
    as part of the XEvent enum varients though

- Run several / hooks for keybindings
  - This means updating the gen_keybindings macro to be able to handle both:
        "key-combo" => single_action
    and,
        "key-combo" => [action1, action2, ...]
  - This may get a bit hairy but it's not as simple as just dropping in a block or the user defining
    an action that triggers multiple things: the ref to the WindowManager needs to be threaded through
    in order to allow for triggering internal methods and that is not going to work easily...
    - Unless, there is just a 'run_many!' macro that acts wraps each action in FireAndForget and then
      triggers them in sequence? It'd work but it's gross and horribly inefficient...probably can do
      a lot better!

- dwm style bar and systray
  - This one is probably a decent amount of work...I still prefer it to having to install and configure
    something like lemonbar/polybar though and exposing the API via xsetroot is a nice touch that I'd
    like to keep.
  - While the Qtile bar I used to have was my favourite by far, I doubt I'm going to be able to
    reproduce that any time soon starting from scratch!

- scratchpads
  - My dwm set up currently has a single scratchpad (a terminal) but I've previously has a set up where
    different bindings triggered scratchpads for different programs. Not decided yet on whether I prefer
    that (hard coded scratch pads) or the ability to tag windows as being on a scratch pad and then
    cycling through them a-la i3.
