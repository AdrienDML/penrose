- additional user facing actions:
  - move client to screen

- Handle mouse events (drag and resize for floating windows)
  - Eventually click to WS switch and other actions from the status bar but that's a long way off

- dwm style bar and systray
  - This one is probably a decent amount of work...I still prefer it to having to install and configure
    something like lemonbar/polybar though and exposing the API via xsetroot is a nice touch that I'd
    like to keep.
  - While the Qtile bar I used to have was my favourite by far, I doubt I'm going to be able to
    reproduce that any time soon starting from scratch!
