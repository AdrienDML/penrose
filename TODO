- multi monitor support
  - some things work fine but there are lots of issues. Need to get an idea of what needs to be done
    and then work out a plan of attack

- additional user facing actions:
  - move client to screen
  - focus screen
  - cycle workspaces

- Handle mouse events (drag and resize for floating windows)
  - Eventually click to WS switch and other actions from the status bar but that's a long way off

- track focused monitor with multi-monitor setup
  - Should be doable with the X-root position info that comes with most events? Need to unack that
    as part of the XEvent enum varients though

- dwm style bar and systray
  - This one is probably a decent amount of work...I still prefer it to having to install and configure
    something like lemonbar/polybar though and exposing the API via xsetroot is a nice touch that I'd
    like to keep.
  - While the Qtile bar I used to have was my favourite by far, I doubt I'm going to be able to
    reproduce that any time soon starting from scratch!

- scratchpads
  - My dwm set up currently has a single scratchpad (a terminal) but I've previously has a set up where
    different bindings triggered scratchpads for different programs. Not decided yet on whether I prefer
    that (hard coded scratch pads) or the ability to tag windows as being on a scratch pad and then
    cycling through them a-la i3.
